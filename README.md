# Greinke

This repository is a case study in baseball analytics and exploratory data analysis using R.
The repository uses data on every pitch thrown by Zack Greinke during the 2015 MLB season. 
These data include information about pitch velocity, pitch type, pitch location, exit speed when the batter makes contact, the game situation (e.g. outs or ball-strike count), and the outcome of each pitch (e.g. strike, foul, home run, or walk).
